# Electri Framework
The Electri Framework is planed and constructed as "replacement" for all the local HTML/CSS/JS Applications out there.
It'll offer an XML-Layout Language like HTML, full CSS Support but backed with a solid Programming Language.

## What happend to "Deadalus"?
The older named "Deadalus Framework" got simply renamed. But why?
Because of simple reasons like:
* Deadalus is written wrong ... and I didn't notice O.o
* Daedalus isn't original and there're already tons of other Dev-Projects out there called like it.
* It didn't really fit anymore and didn't have an outstanding name because of above reasons.

The name "Electri" is from the coffee plant called "Strychnos electri" which takes it's name from the electron.
